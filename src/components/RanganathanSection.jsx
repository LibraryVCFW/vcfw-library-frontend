          <p>
            Dr. S. R. Ranganathan, regarded as the Father of Library Science in
            India, laid the foundation of modern librarianship through his
            visionary principles. His Five Laws of Library Science—Books are for
            use; Every reader his or her book; Every book its reader; Save the
            time of the reader; and The library is a growing organism—continue to
            guide library services, information organization, and user-centric
            knowledge dissemination across the world.
